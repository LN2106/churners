Advanced churn prediction for enhanced customer Retention
In the contemporary business landscape, customer retention is paramount for ensuring sustained growth and profitability. Customer churn, or the loss of customers, presents a significant challenge, driving the need for advanced predictive models. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to developing a hybrid churn prediction model leveraging various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Machines, and XGBoost. By integrating insights from multiple studies and applying rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques, the proposed model aims to enhance predictive accuracy and provide actionable insights for retention strategies. The model's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on real-world datasets, achieving high precision and recall in identifying at-risk customers. This research contributes to the field of predictive analytics by offering a robust framework for churn prediction, ultimately aiding businesses in reducing customer attrition and enhancing customer loyalty.
